The main goal of this project is to gather a significant amount of previous datasets from past years for the field of software development or any other position and their salaries and train the data with machine learning to give the average salary depending on the country specified. This project will serve as a guide for both employers and professionals to stay updated in a shifting economy, and possibly hiring them.
