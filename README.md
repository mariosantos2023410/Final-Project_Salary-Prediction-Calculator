## Introduction

In the dynamic and global field of IT growing almost daily and the amount of new opportunities professionals and companies are always seeking to improve their services. To make it easy, that is where the application comes in, helping them to predict the salary of IT professionals.
This machine-learning web application model will be built from scratch, and it aims to solve a real-world problem. For this project, we will be using the latest public 2023 stack overflow developer survey.

> In May 2023 over 90,000 developers responded to our annual survey about how they learn and level up, which tools they're using, and which ones they want. (Stack Overflow, 2023)

The main goal of this project is to gather a significant amount of previous datasets from past years for the field of software development or any other position and their salaries and train the data with machine learning to give the average salary depending on the country specified. This project will serve as a guide for both employers and professionals to stay updated in a shifting economy, and possibly hiring them.
